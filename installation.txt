Installation

Download the latest version of the Demo distribution and unzip to a directory on your system, such as

    ~/Dev

This will create a folder like this

    ~/Dev/Demo_ObjectiveC_UIKit_EmployeeAdmin_X_Y

Where X_Y is the demo version number.

Inside you will find

    * The source code: src/org/puremvc/objectivec/...
    * The PureMVC static library used by the demo app: lib/PureMVC/PureMVC_ObjectiveC_X_Y.a
    * The PureMVC header files used by the demo app: lib/PureMVC/headers


Setup, Build, and Run the Demo using XCode:

Create a new XCode Project called 'EmployeeAdmin' in XCode.  Make sure to choose the template

    iPhone OS : Application : Window-Based Application
    
From the Groups & Files pane, right click on the Frameworks folder and select

    Add -> Existing Files...

Browse and Add

  ~/Dev/Demo_ObjectiveC_UIKit_EmployeeAdmin_X_Y/lib/PureMVC/PureMVC_ObjectiveC_X_Y.a

Besides the Frameworks folder you should see the static library (.a) listed in the EmployeeAdmin target under the folder, Link Binary With Libraries

From the Groups & Files pane, double click the EmployeeAdmin target or right click and select, Get Info, and then click on the Build tab.

Under the setting, Header Search Paths, add "~/Dev/Demo_ObjectiveC_UIKit_EmployeeAdmin_X_Y/lib/PureMVC/headers"

From the Groups & Files pane, right click on the Classes folder and select

    Add -> Existing Files...

Browse and Add

    ~/Dev/PureMVC/Demo_ObjectiveC_UIKit_EmployeeAdmin/trunk/src/org/puremvc/objectivec/demos/uikit/employeeadmin
    
Open the EmployeeAdminAppDelegate.m in XCode editing window and update the code as follows, then click Build and Go!


#import "EmployeeAdminAppDelegate.h"
#import "ApplicationFacade.h"
#import "EmployeeAdmin.h"

@implementation EmployeeAdminAppDelegate

@synthesize window;

- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {    
  EmployeeAdmin *employeeAdmin = [[[EmployeeAdmin alloc] initWithFrame:[window frame]] autorelease];
	[[ApplicationFacade getInstance] startup:employeeAdmin];
	[window addSubview:employeeAdmin];
  [window makeKeyAndVisible];
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [window release];
    [super dealloc];
}
